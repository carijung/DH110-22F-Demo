### Jakob Nielson's [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) Explained

| Number | Heuristic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | Users should always be informed about what is going on and should be given appropriate feedback to their actions |
| 2 | Match Between System and the Real World | Use concepts and language that are familiar and logical to the user |
| 3 | User Control and Freedom | Allow users to make mistakes; give them options to undo and redo tasks |
| 4 | Consistency and Standards | Follow conventions and make sure design is consistent across the platform |
| 5 | Error Prevention | Get rid of error-prone conditions and provide users with safety nets for high-cost errors |
| 6 | Recognition Rather Than Recall | Minimize user's memory load by giving them suggestions and help in context |
| 7 | Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | Provide multiple ways to perform a task to make the platform accessible to all users |
| 8 | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | Provide only relevant content and features |
| 9 | Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | Tell users what the problem is and provide suggestions to fix it |
| 10 | Help and Documentation | Supply users with extra help to complete their tasks |

## Heuristic Evaluation of UN Environment Programme

## 1. Visibility of System Status

### • Navigation tab
![image](un1.png)

| Severity Rating | Evaluation |  
|---|---|
| Good | When cursor is hovered above the navigation tabs the color changes, indicating that it is clickable. Additionally, the changes in the color allows users to indicate which tab they are currently viewing. These enhance user interactability with the site.|

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### • Search bar

| Severity Rating | Evaluation |  
|---|---|
| 1 | Search bar does not display recommended searches or potential results, therefore providing no guidance to users. Instead, it displays the previously searched phrases which might be inefficient as users already viewed the search results for them. The "Search" placeholder text is vague as users might potentially get confused about where the search will navigate them to. Because the search leads to "References", "Search articles" might be a better option. |

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## 2. Match between system and the real world
### • Navigation tab
![header img](heading.png)
| Severity Rating | Evaluation |
|---|---|
| Good | The navigation tab does not use jargons but instead uses easy to understand phrases like "What we do" do to help users easily navigate the site. |

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### • Parallax scrolling page

| Severity Rating | Evaluation |
|---|---|
| 3 | Consistancy is lost as navigation bar disappears. Requires users to click the back button to explore more tabs.|
| 1 | There is no indication for users to scroll horizontally or vertically which can cause confusion in users. A sign stating "Press '>' to continue" or "Scroll down" would be recommended. |

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### • "What we do" tab

| Severity Rating | Evaluation |
|---|---|
| 3 | User's initial response can potentially be that this is just a list of what the organization does. However, it is clickable and leads to many more resources that users can miss because there are no indications like arrows, bolded letters, or underlines.|

### • "National Scorecard" page
